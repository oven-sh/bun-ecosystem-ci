<h1 align="center">Bun Ecosystem CI</h1>

Runs [Bun](https://bun.sh) against packages and apps in the JavaScript ecosystem.

This Repository has two main purposes:

1. Warn Bun developers of potential regressions before they are released.
2. Show examples of how easy it is to migrate to Bun üê∞

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run tests locally:

```bash
bun start
# See `bun start -h` for a full list of options
```

## Getting Your Package Tested
Want to have your package or app added to this test suite? Reach out to the Bun
team on [Discord](https://bun.sh/discord). We may or may not accept your
request; maintaining each test incurs engineering costs.
